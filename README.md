# Hi! I’m Amanda 👋🏽︎

I’m a newbie in tech who is currently learning JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML and CSS. 
I managed to get started thanks to <a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/" title="Code First Girls Website" target="_blank"> Code First Girls. </a> 
The introductory courses I took have set me on a good path and I'm now continually learning 💻︎.

As a Civil Engineer, I enjoyed being on site and supervising construction. 
Team work definitely made the dream work as various components and different teams had to come together to build something from the ground up :convenience_store: .
I'm now transitioning into tech and enjoying this new challenge I have set for myself.

I enjoy baking, decorating cakes and run a small home-based baking business <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cakeengineersa/?hl=en" title="Cake Engineer SA Instagram Page" target="_blank"> Cake Engineer SA </a>. 🍰
Cake decorating is a form of art which allows my creativity to flow, and is very satisfying.

I enjoy the occassional jog but love taking high intensity group workout classes at the gym instead :slightly_smiling_face:
